# 🌤️ Weather App ("Weatherly")

A responsive web-based weather application that allows users to search for particular locations and view real-time weather conditions and forecasts. The app is built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, and securely fetches data from the OpenWeather API via a backend proxy.

## 📌 What the project does

This Weather App enables users to:

- Search for particular locations and retrieve current weather information.
- View temperature, weather conditions, and multi-day forecasts
- Use autocomplete suggestions to quickly find locations
- Access the application directly through a browser with no setup required
- Add locations to a "Favourites" list, which can then be quickly accessed by the user.

All API requests are routed through a server-side proxy, ensuring that sensitive API keys are never exposed in the frontend.
